## ‚ö° Summary

Hiring is hard and getting hired is even harder. Ghost listings, scams, and spam applications make it tough for everyone. If only we had a way to mitigate this. Now we do.

Agence aims to redefine the job market by introducing a decentralized platform that connects people in a whole new way. Inspired by the _Proof of Stake Consensus Algorithm_, powered by _Base Blockchain_, enabled by _Ethena's USDe Token_, and scaled by _LayerZero_, Agence offers a fresh solution to a global problem.

## üéØ Objective

Agence is modelled after the proof of stake consensus algorithm meaning for users to interact with the platform they must stake and lock up their USDe token in the [Agence Treasury Contract](contracts/ethereum/src/AgenceTreasury.sol) in the promise that they will not be malicious. This not only creates a safe space for other users to hire and get hired but since the staked tokens accrue the estimated 15% APY, users are rewarded for voting against malicious behavior.

Agence aims to be a one stop shop for job seekers and job providers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

1. **Ethena's USDe Token**: Ethena's USDe token is the chosen stable coin for Agence; To create a gig, a user (agency) has to first lock a binding amount of USDe tokens for the entirety of the gig duration. This tokens is then staked

2. **LayerZero**: The Agence Token (ATK) is a LayerZero OFT token meant to enable users vote from various evm blockchains.

3. **Base Blockchain**: The primary blockchain that powers Agence.

## ‚úÖ Features

- [x] The User Interface is up and running.
- [x] The Agence Gigs contract is completed.
- [x] The Agence Governance contract is completed.

## üöß Development

This project is actively being developed, Please always check back for updates as I am rushing to finish v1. These are the features I will be implementing in the coming days.

- [ ] Convert the Governace contract into a LayerZero oApp for cross chain voting.
- [ ] Update the Agence Token to be a LayerZero OFT token and use that on the UI.
- [ ] Deploy the Smart Contracts to the Base Sepolia Testnet.
- [ ] Integrate the Agence contracts into the UI and enable users to vote.
- [ ] Remove the Dummy Data from the UI.
- [ ] Update the Documentation and Reduce this README.md so I don't bore my readers. üôÉ
